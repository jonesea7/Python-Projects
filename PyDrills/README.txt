This is a collection of drills from the Python Course.

The file:

drillPage100.py

is the version of the script for the drill on page 100 that goes along with the made up directory in this repo.

The file:

PyIODrill.py

is the more complicated version of the drill that I was trying to execute by
building the directory and adding files in the script along with printing out the time stamp.
